# Covid-19-Data-analysis-portfolio-project
An exploratory Data Analysis project on the analysis of the Global Covid-19 datasets sourced from www.Ourworldindata.org. CSV and Excel (.xlsx) datasets moved into a created database in SQL Server where several Query statements were written to explore the data. Created views in SQL Server were imported to Tableau for visualizations.
